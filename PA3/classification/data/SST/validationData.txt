makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
my reaction in a word : disappointment .
the intent is almost exactly the same ( as the full monty ) .
utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni 's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
once ( kim ) begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .
inside the film 's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it 's not that , it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat .
it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away .
lapaglia 's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver 's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class .
further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of dubya 's axis of evil .
preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment .
without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelström is just another winter sleepers .
two hours fly by -- opera 's a pleasure when you do n't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated .
filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels .
nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .
more whiny downer than corruscating commentary .
( serry ) wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition .
this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well .
the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .
if your taste runs to ` difficult ' films you absolutely ca n't miss it .
do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk .
this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate\/surf culture , the l.a. beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults .
it gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right .
green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .
once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
not for the prurient or squeamish , it 's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics .
there can be no other explanation .
chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson 's dahmer .
there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine .
the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .
( e ) ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism .
just one bad idea after another .
it inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental ` picture shows . '
serving sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .
prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this english trifle .
they should have called it gutterball .
i 've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .
yakusho and shimizu ... create engaging characterizations in imamura 's lively and enjoyable cultural mix .
the old-world - meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie 's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco bollywood that , by the end of monsoon wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater .
( t ) here 's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them .
while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
a movie with a real anarchic flair .
that is a compliment to kuras and miller .
it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i ca n't wait for the sequel .
a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back .
the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .
the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge .
its maker , steven spielberg , has n't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray .
broomfield turns his distinctive ` blundering ' style into something that could really help clear up the case .
smart , provocative and blisteringly funny .
` de niro ... is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around . '
is not easy .
the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
a spellbinding african film about the modern condition of rootlessness , a state experienced by millions around the globe .
beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama .
this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film .
it 's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way .
indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie .
thanks to scott 's charismatic roger and eisenberg 's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men .
for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he 's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars .
corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .
it 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness ( which always relates to characters and story ) and johnny dankworth 's best soundtrack in years .
the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
candid camera on methamphetamines .
ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it .
skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .
a great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .
despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed .
i do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool .
part three stooges .
it 's a beautiful madness .
at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it 's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form 's history .
the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens .
the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
remember the kind of movie we were hoping `` ecks vs. sever '' or `` xxx '' was going to be ?
